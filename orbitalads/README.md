**By using *React + Typescript* you have to create a multi select *component* that allows the user to:**
- Select item by item
- See the selected items
- Filter the available items
- Clear all the selected items

**We will value that:**
- you created *reusable components*
- you provided a nice component design so other developers can consume and understand the component easily
- you coded based on the requirements but also thought on possible new features
- you didn't create more than the necessary DOM elements
- you delivered a good solution eventhough not all functionalities work

_Tip: We encourage the usage of React API's *Children* functions._

Here's a sample of this functionalities working and how the look and feel should look like:

_You can style the project components however you want. Css, Sass, Less, CSS-in-JS..._

**Also, we will ask to be able to:**
- Run the project locally by running `npm start`
- Compile the project by running `npm run build`

_You can use whatever transpilers and compiler tool you want to._
